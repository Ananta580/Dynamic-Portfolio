# Dynamic Portfolio
This is a portfolio website "Template" in which everything is dynamic and is fetched from a JSON file, Implemented in angular and easy to get started.
If you want to use this template just navigate to src/assets/Info.json and change the variables values to see those changes.

Then, follow these instructions: 

## Development and Build server
Run `ng serve` and watch in localhost:4200
Run `ng build` and it will make a deployable code in `/deploy` folder.

# Note.
This is my personal portfolio and is hosted in https://www.ananta-poudel.com.np/.
